# Operator Training and Certification

## Purpose

Establishes standardized training and certification requirements to ensure operators possess the competence required to safely and consistently operate manufacturing equipment.

## Scope

This policy applies to all personnel operating CNC machines, presses, robotic systems, conveyors, and inspection equipment within the facility.

## Training Structure

Training programs combine classroom instruction, supervised hands-on operation, and competency assessments. Modules cover equipment fundamentals, safety protocols, quality expectations, and basic troubleshooting.

## Certification Process

Operators are certified only after demonstrating proficiency under observation by qualified trainers. Certifications are equipment-specific and time-bound, requiring periodic revalidation.

## Records and Audits

Training completion, certification status, and recertification dates are maintained in a centralized training database. Records are reviewed during internal audits and regulatory inspections.

## Continuous Skill Development

Performance incidents, near-misses, and quality deviations are analyzed to identify training gaps and update curricula accordingly.
