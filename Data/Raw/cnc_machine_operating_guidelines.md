# CNC Machine Operating Guidelines

## Purpose

Provides standardized operating procedures to ensure machining accuracy, equipment longevity, repeatability, and operator safety across all CNC machining centers.

## Scope

Applies to all vertical and horizontal CNC machines, including milling, turning, and multi-axis machining centers.

## Pre-Startup Checks

Operators must verify:

* Machine guarding and interlocks

* Coolant concentration and flow

* Lubrication system status

* Tool holder integrity and cleanliness

* Program version correctness

## Startup Procedures

* Power up following OEM sequence

* Run spindle warm-up cycles

* Reference machine axes

* Load approved programs and tooling offsets

## Normal Operation

* Monitor spindle load, vibration, and temperature indicators

* Inspect first-off parts for dimensional accuracy

* Respond promptly to alarms and warnings

* Record anomalies, overrides, or adjustments in machine logs

## Shutdown Procedures

* Safely stop machining cycles

* Park axes and secure tooling

* Remove chips and clean work area

* Power down systems according to standard sequence

## Oversight and Review

Manufacturing engineers review CNC logs weekly to identify recurring issues, tool wear trends, and optimization opportunities.
