# Spare Parts Inventory Management

## Purpose

Defines how spare parts are identified, tracked, stored, issued, and replenished to support uninterrupted manufacturing operations.

## Scope

This document applies to all mechanical, electrical, pneumatic, and electronic spare parts associated with production machines, utilities equipment, and safety systems across the plant.

## Inventory Classification

Spare parts are categorized as critical, essential, or non-critical based on their impact on production continuity, safety risk, and lead time. Critical spares are those whose absence would result in immediate line stoppage or safety exposure. Essential spares affect throughput but allow limited operation. Non-critical spares have minimal short-term operational impact.

## Stock Monitoring and Thresholds

Each spare part is assigned a minimum stock level, reorder point, and preferred supplier. Inventory levels are monitored through a centralized maintenance management system that records part issuance, returns, and consumption rates. Automatic alerts are generated when stock levels approach predefined thresholds.

## Usage Analysis and Forecasting

Historical usage data is analyzed to identify consumption trends, failure correlations, and seasonality effects. This information supports demand forecasting, budget planning, and predictive maintenance strategies by ensuring parts availability ahead of anticipated failures.

## Storage and Traceability

All spare parts are labeled with part numbers, machine associations, and shelf-life constraints where applicable. Environmental storage conditions are controlled to prevent degradation. Lot numbers and supplier information are retained for traceability and quality investigations.

## Continuous Improvement

Inventory performance metrics such as stock-out events, carrying costs, and emergency procurement frequency are reviewed quarterly to refine stocking strategies and supplier agreements.
