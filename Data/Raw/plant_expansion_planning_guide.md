# Plant Expansion Planning Guide

## Purpose

Provides a structured framework for scaling production capacity while preserving operational stability, data continuity, and quality standards.

## Scope

Applies to physical expansion, capacity upgrades, new production lines, and integration of additional automation systems.

## Capacity Assessment

Expansion planning begins with quantitative analysis of:

* Current throughput constraints

* Bottleneck machines and processes

* Forecasted demand and order mix variability

## Equipment Selection

Candidate equipment is evaluated based on:

* Technical compatibility with existing systems

* Maintenance and reliability characteristics

* Data connectivity and sensor readiness

* Vendor support and lifecycle costs

## Layout and Flow Design

Facility layouts are designed to minimize material handling, reduce congestion, and support logical data segmentation by line or cell.

## Systems Integration

New assets are integrated into:

* Maintenance systems

* Production scheduling tools

* Data pipelines and analytics platforms

## Risk Management

Expansion risks are identified and mitigated through phased commissioning and pilot runs.
