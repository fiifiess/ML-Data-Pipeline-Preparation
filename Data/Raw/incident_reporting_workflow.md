# Incident Reporting Workflow

## Purpose

Defines how operational, safety, and data-related incidents are captured, investigated, and resolved.

## Scope

Applies to equipment failures, safety events, data integrity issues, and environmental incidents.

## Reporting

Incidents are logged through a centralized system with timestamps, location, equipment identifiers, and initial descriptions.

## Investigation

Assigned investigators analyze machine logs, sensor data, and operator reports to reconstruct events.

## Resolution

Corrective and preventive actions are defined, implemented, and verified for effectiveness.

## Closure and Learning

Closed incidents feed into risk registers, training updates, and system improvements.
