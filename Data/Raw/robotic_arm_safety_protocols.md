# Robotic Arm Safety Protocols

## Purpose

Defines mandatory safety requirements for the operation, programming, and maintenance of robotic workcells.

## Scope

Covers all industrial robots, collaborative robots, end effectors, and peripheral automation equipment.

## Core Safety Measures

* Lockout–Tagout (LOTO) procedures during maintenance and troubleshooting

* Daily validation of emergency stop functionality

* Physical guarding, fencing, and light curtains

* Clearly marked safety zones and restricted access areas

## Programming and Testing

Robot programs must be tested in reduced-speed or simulation modes before full-speed production deployment.

## Incident Handling and Escalation

All safety incidents, near-misses, or unexpected robot behaviors must be reported within 24 hours to the plant safety officer and logged in the incident management system.

## Compliance

Protocols align with applicable industrial safety standards and regulatory requirements.
