# Data Retention and Archiving Policy

## Purpose

Defines how manufacturing data is retained, archived, protected, and disposed of to support regulatory compliance, operational continuity, analytics reliability, and historical traceability.

## Scope

Applies to all data generated across manufacturing operations, including machine logs, sensor streams, maintenance records, quality inspection data, production reports, and analytics outputs.

## Data Categories

Manufacturing data is classified into distinct categories, each with tailored retention rules:

* Operational data (machine logs, sensor readings)

* Maintenance data (work orders, failure records, calibration logs)

* Quality data (inspection results, SPC charts, defect reports)

* Compliance data (audit records, safety incidents, environmental logs)

* Analytical artifacts (feature tables, model outputs, evaluation reports)

## Retention Rules

Retention periods are determined by:

* Regulatory and contractual obligations

* Equipment lifecycle requirements

* Analytical and model retraining needs

* Risk exposure and audit considerations

Critical records are retained for extended periods to support long-term trend analysis and legal defensibility.

## Archiving Strategy

Older or low-access data is migrated to cost-efficient archival storage while remaining searchable. Archived datasets retain timestamps, identifiers, schemas, and access controls.

## Secure Disposal

Data exceeding retention limits is securely deleted following documented approval workflows. Disposal actions are logged for auditability.
