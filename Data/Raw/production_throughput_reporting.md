## Purpose

Explains how production output metrics are collected, validated, analyzed, and communicated to support operational control and planning.

## Scope

Covers machine-level output, line throughput, shift performance, and plant-wide summaries.

## Data Sources

Throughput data originates from:

* Machine counters and PLC signals

* Manufacturing execution systems

* Manual confirmations where automation is unavailable

## Validation Logic

Data is checked for completeness, duplication, and alignment with downtime events.

## Reporting Cadence

Metrics are presented:

* In near real time to operators

* Daily and weekly to management

## Analytical Usage

Throughput trends are used to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and improvement opportunities.
