# Machine Failure Classification Guide

## Purpose

Provides a standardized taxonomy for describing and analyzing equipment failures.

## Scope

Applies to all failure events affecting production equipment, automation systems, and supporting utilities.

## Classification Dimensions

Failures are categorized by:

* Primary cause (mechanical, electrical, software, sensor)

* Failure mode (wear, overload, misalignment, configuration)

* Operational impact (minor, major, critical)

## Usage in Analysis

Consistent classification enables trend analysis, prioritization of corrective actions, and model feature labeling.

## Governance

Updates to failure categories require cross-functional approval to preserve historical comparability.
