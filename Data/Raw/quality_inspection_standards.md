# Quality Inspection Standards

## Purpose

Defines consistent inspection practices to verify that manufactured parts meet design, regulatory, and customer requirements.

## Scope

Applies to in-process inspections, final inspections, and audit sampling across all product families.

## Inspection Methods

* Dimensional measurement using gauges and CMMs

* Surface finish and visual inspection

* Functional testing where applicable

## Defect Classification

Nonconformities are categorized by severity, frequency, and impact on downstream assembly or safety.

## Data Handling

Inspection results are logged digitally and linked to production batches, machines, and operators.

## Continuous Feedback

Inspection data feeds statistical process control (SPC), root cause investigations, and improvement initiatives.
