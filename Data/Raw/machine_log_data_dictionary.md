# Machine Log Data Dictionary

## Purpose

Documents and standardizes all machine log fields to ensure consistency across data ingestion, analytics, troubleshooting, and machine learning workflows.

## Scope

Applies to logs generated by CNC machines, robotic cells, conveyors, presses, inspection systems, and auxiliary equipment.

## Design Principles

* Logs must be machine-readable and human-interpretable

* Field definitions must remain stable over time

* Units and timestamps must be explicit

* Fields should support both real-time monitoring and historical analysis

## Core Log Categories

Machine logs are grouped into the following categories:

* Operational status logs

* Alarm and event logs

* Performance and utilization logs

* Sensor summary logs

* Operator interaction logs

## Standard Fields

Each machine log record includes, at minimum:

* Timestamp (ISO 8601 format)

* Machine ID

* Line or cell ID

* Event type

* Severity level

* Source subsystem

## Measurement Fields

Where applicable, logs include measured values such as:

* Temperature (°C)

* Vibration (mm/s)

* Pressure (bar)

* Spindle speed (RPM)

* Power consumption (kW)

## Data Quality Rules

* Missing values must be explicitly flagged

* Out-of-range values are logged with validation errors

* Duplicate events are de-duplicated at ingestion

## Analytics Usage

Machine log fields support:

* Root cause analysis

* Downtime attribution

* Predictive maintenance feature engineering

KPI calculation

## Governance

Changes to log schemas require approval from manufacturing engineering, IT, and data teams.

## Change Control

Schema modifications require cross-functional approval to preserve historical comparability.
