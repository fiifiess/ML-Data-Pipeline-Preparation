# Sensor Calibration Procedures

## Purpose

Ensures measurement accuracy and data integrity for sensors used in control, monitoring, and analytics applications.

## Scope

Covers temperature, vibration, pressure, flow, and energy sensors installed on production and utility equipment.

## Calibration Triggers

Calibration is performed:

* On a fixed monthly schedule

* After major maintenance or component replacement

* When sensor drift or anomalies are detected

## Calibration Methodology

Technicians use certified reference instruments and documented procedures to adjust sensor outputs to known standards.

## Verification and Acceptance

Post-calibration checks confirm sensor accuracy within allowable tolerances before reactivation.

## Recordkeeping

Calibration records include reference values, adjustment results, technician identification, and approval status for auditability.
