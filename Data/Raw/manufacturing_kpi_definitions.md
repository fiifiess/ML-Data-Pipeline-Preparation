# Manufacturing KPI Definitions

## Purpose

Establishes a shared vocabulary for evaluating manufacturing performance across operations, engineering, and management teams.

## Scope

KPIs apply at machine, line, plant, and enterprise levels.

## Core KPIs

* Uptime: Percentage of scheduled time equipment is operational

* Defect Rate: Ratio of defective units to total output

* Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF): Average operating time between failure events

* Mean Time To Repair (MTTR): Average duration to restore equipment

* Energy Efficiency: Output produced per unit of energy consumed

## Calculation Rules

Each KPI has a standardized formula, data source definition, and aggregation window to prevent inconsistent reporting.

## Usage Context

KPIs inform maintenance prioritization, production planning, investment decisions, and continuous improvement initiatives.

## Analytical Role

KPIs are used as model targets, evaluation metrics, and performance baselines in analytics workflows.
