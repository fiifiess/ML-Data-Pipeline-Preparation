# Preventive Maintenance Program Overview

## Purpose

This document explains how preventive maintenance (PM) is planned, scheduled, executed, monitored, and continuously improved across all production equipment within the plant.

## Scope

The preventive maintenance program applies to CNC machines, stamping presses, conveyors, robotic arms, automated inspection systems, utilities (compressed air, HVAC, boilers), and supporting infrastructure.

## Maintenance Philosophy

The organization adopts a reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) approach that balances preventive, predictive, and corrective maintenance activities to maximize equipment availability while controlling costs.

## Planning and Scheduling

Maintenance intervals are determined using a hybrid decision model that considers:

* OEM-recommended service intervals

* Machine runtime hours and duty cycles

* Sensor-derived condition indicators

* Historical failure frequency and severity

* Production criticality of each asset

Maintenance schedules are reviewed monthly and adjusted based on equipment performance trends.

## Execution

Technicians perform maintenance using standardized work instructions and digital checklists. Tasks include inspection, lubrication, alignment, part replacement, and functional testing. Deviations from expected conditions are documented.

## Documentation and Traceability

Each maintenance activity is logged in the CMMS with timestamps, technician identifiers, asset IDs, task outcomes, replaced components, and verification results. These records support audits, analytics, and model training.

## Continuous Improvement

Maintenance effectiveness is reviewed using KPIs such as MTBF, MTTR, and repeat failure rates. Lessons learned feed back into task definitions and maintenance intervals.
