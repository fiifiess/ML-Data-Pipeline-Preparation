# Energy Consumption Monitoring

## Purpose

Describes how energy usage is measured, analyzed, and optimized across manufacturing equipment and plant utilities.

## Scope

This document covers electricity, compressed air, steam, and cooling energy consumption associated with production lines, auxiliary systems, and facility infrastructure.

## Data Collection

Energy meters and sensors capture real-time and aggregated consumption data at machine, line, and plant levels. Data is timestamped and synchronized with production activity to enable contextual analysis.

## Analysis and Optimization

Energy data is evaluated to identify abnormal consumption patterns, idle energy losses, and efficiency degradation. Engineers correlate energy usage with machine states such as startup, steady operation, and downtime to uncover optimization opportunities.

## Reporting and Governance

Energy performance indicators are summarized in daily and monthly reports for operations and sustainability teams. Deviations from baseline targets trigger investigations and corrective actions.

## Strategic Use

Insights from energy monitoring inform equipment upgrades, production scheduling decisions, and environmental compliance reporting, supporting cost reduction and sustainability goals.
