# Shift Handover Procedures

## Purpose

Ensures seamless operational continuity and shared situational awareness between outgoing and incoming production shifts.

## Scope

Applies to all production lines, maintenance teams, and control room operations.

## Outgoing Shift Responsibilities

Outgoing personnel document:

* Machine and line status

* Active alarms or abnormal conditions

* Temporary fixes or workarounds

* Pending maintenance or quality issues

## Incoming Shift Review

Incoming operators review handover notes, verify machine status, and acknowledge responsibility before resuming production.

## Communication Standards

Handover information is recorded digitally to ensure traceability and reduce reliance on verbal communication.

## Impact

Effective handovers reduce repeat incidents, startup delays, and information loss.
